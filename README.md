## Overview

The **YouTube Bookmark Extension** enhances your YouTube experience by enabling you to bookmark timestamps in a video with a single click. Each bookmark includes a title, the video ID, and the exact timestamp, allowing you to jump back to that moment instantly.

This extension is built to be user-friendly, lightweight, and easy to use, providing seamless interaction with YouTube.

## Features

- **Bookmark Timestamps**: Bookmark any moment in a YouTube video by clicking a button.
- **View Bookmarks**: Display a list of all saved bookmarks for the current video.
- **Jump to Timestamp**: Click on any saved bookmark to directly jump to the specified timestamp.
- **Persistent Storage**: Bookmarks are stored locally and persist between sessions.
- **Remove Bookmarks**: Easily delete bookmarks you no longer need.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile versions of YouTube.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: Used to build the popup interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core logic for capturing video ID, timestamps, and communicating with YouTube's DOM.
- **Chrome Extensions API**: Utilized to interact with the browser and store data.
- **Local Storage**: Bookmarks are stored in the browser's local storage.
- **React (Optional)**: You can use React for the popup interface to make it dynamic and scalable.
- **Webpack (Optional)**: Bundler for modularizing and managing the extension's assets (JavaScript, CSS).
